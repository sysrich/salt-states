##### WPA/IEEE 802.11i configuration ##########################################

# Enable WPA. Setting this variable configures the AP to require WPA (either
# WPA-PSK or WPA-RADIUS/EAP based on other configuration). For WPA-PSK, either
# wpa_psk or wpa_passphrase must be set and wpa_key_mgmt must include WPA-PSK.
# Instead of wpa_psk / wpa_passphrase, wpa_psk_radius might suffice.
# For WPA-RADIUS/EAP, ieee8021x must be set (but without dynamic WEP keys),
# RADIUS authentication server must be configured, and WPA-EAP must be included
# in wpa_key_mgmt.
# This field is a bit field that can be used to enable WPA (IEEE 802.11i/D3.0)
# and/or WPA2 (full IEEE 802.11i/RSN):
# bit0 = WPA
# bit1 = IEEE 802.11i/RSN (WPA2) (dot11RSNAEnabled)
wpa=2

# WPA pre-shared keys for WPA-PSK. This can be either entered as a 256-bit
# secret in hex format (64 hex digits), wpa_psk, or as an ASCII passphrase
# (8..63 characters) that will be converted to PSK. This conversion uses SSID
# so the PSK changes when ASCII passphrase is used and the SSID is changed.

# configuration reloads.

# CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC [RFC 3610, IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol [IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# Group cipher suite (encryption algorithm for broadcast and multicast frames)
# is automatically selected based on this configuration. If only CCMP is
# allowed as the pairwise cipher, group cipher will also be CCMP. Otherwise,
# TKIP will be used as the group cipher.

##### Multiple BSSID support ##################################################
#
# Above configuration is using the default interface (wlan#, or multi-SSID VLAN
# interfaces). Other BSSIDs can be added by using separator 'bss' with
# default interface name to be allocated for the data packets of the new BSS.
#
# hostapd will generate BSSID mask based on the BSSIDs that are
# configured. hostapd will verify that dev_addr & MASK == dev_addr. If this is
# not the case, the MAC address of the radio must be changed before starting
# hostapd (ifconfig wlan0 hw ether <MAC addr>). If a BSSID is configured for
# every secondary BSS, this limitation is not applied at hostapd and other
# masks may be used if the driver supports them (e.g., swap the locally
# administered bit)
#
# BSSIDs are assigned in order to each BSS, unless an explicit BSSID is
# specified using the 'bssid' parameter.
# If an explicit BSSID is specified, it must be chosen such that it:
# - results in a valid MASK that covers it and the dev_addr
# - is not the same as the MAC address of the radio
# - is not the same as any other explicitly specified BSSID
#
# Not all drivers support multiple BSSes. The exact mechanism for determining
# the driver capabilities is driver specific. With the current (i.e., a recent
# kernel) drivers using nl80211, this information can be checked with "iw list"
# (search for "valid interface combinations").
#
# Please note that hostapd uses some of the values configured for the first BSS
# as the defaults for the following BSSes. However, it is recommended that all
# BSSes include explicit configuration of all relevant configuration items.
#
#bss=wlan0_0
#ssid=test2
# most of the above items can be used here (apart from radio interface specific
# items, like channel)
